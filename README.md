# RAD-Seq-data-analysis
Population Genetics Analysis of Endemic Species, Isophya rizeensis 
# Genetic Data Analysis

This repository contains my analysis of genetic data. The project involves using statistical methods and bioinformatics tools to explore genetic variations. Conducting several population genetic analysis to RAD-Seq data, we'll find the adaptive regions that might be cause the Isophya rizeensis adaptation with altitudional gradient.


## Structure of the Repository
- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed genetic data.
- `scripts/`: Python/R scripts used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python/R/bash/java
- angsd, pcangsd, ngsadmix, samtools, bcftools (for linux/bash)
- ggplot2, adegenet, LEA, vegan (for R)
