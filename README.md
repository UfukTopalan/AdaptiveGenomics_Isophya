# Genetic Data Analysis 

This repository is dedicated to my research and analysis of genetic data, utilizing advanced statistical methods and bioinformatics tools to explore genetic variation across populations. The goal of the project is to identify patterns, perform statistical tests, and conduct visualizations to better understand genetic structures and evolutionary dynamics.

## Structure

- `scripts_folder/`: Python/R/shell scripts used for all analysis.

## Tools and Libraries

### Python
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **SciPy**: Statistical methods and scientific computing
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization

## R:

- **ggplot2**: Data visualization
- **dplyr**: Data manipulation
- **viridis**: Color maps for visualization
- **LEA**: Landscape of Evolutionary Aspects (for genetic association analysis)
- **lfmm**: Latent Factor Mixed Models (for environmental association analysis)
- **qvalue**: Estimation of false discovery rates
- **vegan**: Community ecology analysis

### Cluster Tools
- **ANGSD**: Software for analyzing next-generation sequencing data, particularly for estimating genotype likelihoods and performing population genetic analyses.
- **pcangsd**: Principal Component Analysis tool integrated with ANGSD for visualizing genetic variation and population structure.
- **ngsadmix**: Tool for estimating ancestry proportions from next-generation sequencing data, useful for population admixture analysis.
- **Java (Picard)**: Suite of command-line tools for manipulating high-throughput sequencing data, including sorting and merging of BAM files.
- **samtools**: Tools for processing and analyzing alignment data in BAM/SAM format, including sorting, indexing, and variant calling.
- **bcftools**: Toolkit for working with VCF (Variant Call Format) files, including filtering, merging, and querying variants.
- **bwa mem**: Alignment tool for mapping high-throughput sequencing reads against a reference genome, known for its accuracy and speed.
