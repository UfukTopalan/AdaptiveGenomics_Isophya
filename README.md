# Genetic Data Analysis 

This repository is dedicated to my research and analysis of genetic data, utilizing advanced statistical methods and bioinformatics tools to explore genetic variation across populations. The goal of the project is to identify patterns, perform statistical tests, and conduct visualizations to better understand genetic structures and evolutionary dynamics.

## Structure

- `scripts_folder/`: Python/R/shell scripts used for all analysis.

## Tools and Libraries

## Python:
- pandas, NumPy, SciPy for data manipulation and statistical tests
- matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

## R:

- ggplot2, dplyr, viridis for statistical modeling and plotting
- LEA, lfmm, qvalue, vegan for environmental and genetic association analysis
