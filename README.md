Genetic Data Analysis Repository
This repository is dedicated to my research and analysis of genetic data, utilizing advanced statistical methods and bioinformatics tools to explore genetic variation across populations. The goal of the project is to identify patterns, perform statistical tests, and conduct visualizations to better understand genetic structures and evolutionary dynamics.
